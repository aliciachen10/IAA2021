Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Attribute Information:

1) ID number 
2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 


Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: 

3) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) 
4) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) 
5) perimeter 
6) area 
7) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) 
8) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) 
9) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) 
10) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) 
11) symmetry 
12) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
