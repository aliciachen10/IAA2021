Trade capital expense for variable expense: Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources and pay only the amount you consume. 

Benefit from massive economies of scale: By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as Amazon Web Services can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices. 

Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision before deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice (Elasticity)

Increase speed and agility: In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, because the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, instead of on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers. 

Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers simply and at minimal cost.
